# Contributing to CTS Protocol

This is day one. The spec is simple. The conversation is what matters.

## How to Contribute

### Discuss
- Open an issue to discuss edge cases
- Challenge the core assumptions
- Share use cases we haven't considered

### Extend
- Propose schema extensions for specific domains (healthcare, finance, etc.)
- Suggest metadata fields that preserve the spirit of human tethering
- Identify integration points with MCP and other protocols

### Build
- Reference implementations in any language
- Validation libraries
- Middleware for existing agent frameworks

### Spread
- Write about why this matters
- Talk about it in your communities
- Push back on untethered agent architectures

## Principles for Contributions

1. **Keep it simple.** The core is three fields. Resist complexity that doesn't serve human tethering.

2. **Preserve the spirit.** Extensions should make the human stake *more* visible, not less. If a proposal lets the system forget who it's for, it's going the wrong direction.

3. **Assume good faith, design for adversaries.** The protocol should make doing the right thing easy, and gaming it detectable.

4. **Mortality is non-negotiable.** The `mortal: true` field isn't a formality. It's the point. Proposals that abstract away human finitude miss the purpose.

## What We Need Right Now

- [ ] Reference implementation in Python
- [ ] Reference implementation in TypeScript
- [ ] MCP integration proposal
- [ ] Goose plugin/extension
- [ ] Validation middleware for common agent frameworks
- [ ] More edge case examples
- [ ] Translations of core docs

## Code of Conduct

Be good to each other. We're trying to keep humans in the loop — let's act like the humans we want to keep there.

## Questions?

Open an issue. This is a conversation.
